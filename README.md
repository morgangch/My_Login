# My_Login
An experience for myself to improve my abilities to code Web login and signup system
Made in Node.js, HTML, CSS (for a bit of design)
It checks out the given password and its strenght.
The validity of the mail is not (yet) checked.
It keeps the mail and username in cache (to keep in cache who is logged in)
This is everything for now.
